7. What is the best time complexity of bubble sort?
(A) N^2
(B) NlogN
(C) N
(D) N(logN)^2
Answer: (C) 
Explanation: The bubble sort is at its best if the input data is sorted. i.e. If the input data is sorted in the same order as expected output. 
This can be achieved by using one boolean variable. The boolean variable is used to check whether the values are swapped at least once in the inner loop.


8.The tightest lower bound on the number of comparisons, in the worst case, for comparison-based sorting is of the order of
(A) N
(B) N^2
(C) NlogN
(D) N(logN)^2
Answer: (C) 
Explanation: The number of comparisons that a comparison sort algorithm requires increases in proportion to Nlog(N), where N is the number of elements to sort. This bound is asymptotically tight:
Given a list of distinct numbers (we can assume this because this is a worst-case analysis), there are N factorial permutations exactly one of which is the list in sorted order. 
The sort algorithm must gain enough information from the comparisons to identify the correct permutations. 
If the algorithm always completes after at most f(N) steps, it cannot distinguish more than 2^f(N) cases because the keys are distinct and each comparison has only two possible outcomes. 
Therefore, 2^f(N) >= N! or equivalently f(N) >= log(N!).
Since log(N!) is Omega(NlogN), the answer is NlogN.

10. Let P be a singly linked list. Let Q be the pointer to an intermediate node x in the list. What is the worst-case time complexity of the best known algorithm to delete the node x from the list?
A.O(n) B.O(log2n) C.O(logn) D.O(1)---correct


11. Consider the following function to traverse a linked list.
void traverse(struct Node *head)
{
   while (head->next != NULL)
   {
       cout<<head->data<<" ";
       head = head->next;
   }
}
Which of the following is FALSE about above function?
(A) The function may crash when the linked list is empty
(B) The function doesn’t print the last node when the linked list is not empty
(C) The function is implemented incorrectly because it changes head
Answer: (C) 


12. You are given pointers to first and last nodes of a singly linked list, which of the following operations are dependent on the length of the linked list?
(A) Delete the first element
(B) Insert a new element as a first element
(C) Delete the last element of the list
(D) Add a new element at the end of the list
Answer: (C) 
Explanation: a) Can be done in O(1) time by deleting memory and changing the first pointer.
b) Can be done in O(1) time, see push() here
c) Delete the last element requires pointer to previous of last, which can only be obtained by traversing the list.
d) Can be done in O(1) by changing next of last and then last.


13. Suppose each set is represented as a linked list with elements in arbitrary order. Which of the following set operations is the fastest?

(D) cardinality
Answer: (C) 


14. Consider the following function that takes reference to head of a Doubly Linked List as parameter. 
Assume that a node of doubly linked list has previous pointer as prev and next pointer as next.
void fun(struct node **head_ref)
{
    struct node *temp = NULL;
    struct node *current = *head_ref;
 
    while (current !=  NULL)
    {
        temp = current->prev;
        current->prev = current->next;
        current->next = temp;
        current = current->prev;
    }
 
    if(temp != NULL )
        *head_ref = temp->prev;
}
Assume that reference of head of following doubly linked list is passed to above function
1 <--> 2 <--> 3 <--> 4 <--> 5 <-->6.
What should be the modified linked list after the function call?
(A) 2 <--> 1 <--> 4 <--> 3 <--> 6 <-->5
(B) 5 <--> 4 <--> 3 <--> 2 <--> 1 <-->6.

16. The following postfix expression with single digit operands is evaluated using a stack: 8 2 3 ^ / 2 3 * + 5 1 * - 
Note that ^ is the exponentiation operator. The top two elements of the stack after the first * is evaluated are:
(A) 6, 1
(B) 5, 7
(C) 3, 2
(D) 1, 5
Answer: (A) 


17. A single array A[1..MAXSIZE] is used to implement two stacks. The two stacks grow from opposite ends of the array. 
Variables top1 and top2 (topl< top 2) point to the location of the topmost element in each of the stacks. 
If the space is to be used efficiently, the condition for “stack full” is
(A) (top1 = MAXSIZE/2) and (top2 = MAXSIZE/2+1)
(B) top1 + top2 = MAXSIZE
(C) (top1= MAXSIZE/2) or (top2 = MAXSIZE)
(D) top1= top2 -1
Answer: (D) 
Explanation: If we are to use space efficiently then size of the any stack can be more than MAXSIZE/2.
Both stacks will grow from both ends and if any of the stack top reaches near to the other top then stacks are full. 
So the condition will be top1 = top2 -1 (given that top1 < top2)


18. Following is pseudo code of a function that takes a number as an argument, and uses a stack s to do processing.
void fun(int n){
    stack s;
    while (n > 0){
		s.push(n%2);
		n = n/2;
    }
    while (!isEmpty(s))
		cout<<pop(s)<<" "; 
}

(A) Prints binary representation of n in reverse order
(B) Prints binary representation of n
(C) Prints the value of Logn
(D) Prints the value of Logn in reverse order
Answer: (B) 


19. Which one of the following is an application of Queue Data Structure?
