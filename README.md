This repository contains coding assignments and personal notes that are utilized in my Data Structures and Algorithms course. The intended purpose of this repository is for me to keep track of algorithms taught in the course as well as to showcase to others my abilities.

All items in this repository are the sole work of Brandon Goldman (unless otherwise noted) and are available for you to use as a studying aid. However, don't steal my coding assignments and claim them as your own.
